bcnsocial:  A social schedule for BarCamp Nashville
===================================================

This PHP-based application was designed to scrape schedule details for the BarCamp Nashville website and display them in a user-friendly grid.  Users can then select the sessions they wish to attend and other users can use the Twilio or Twitter features to ask BCNSocial where a friend or someone they are interested in talking to most likely is at that time based on what sessions they chose from BCNSocial.

## Dependencies ##

PHP 5.2+
